*Under construction*

This repository hosts data from tables of figures in papers that I've published (and possibly ancillary data), in machine-readable format.

To be included:

 * Sifón+17: [*A First Constraint on the Average Mass of Ultra Diffuse Galaxies from Weak Gravitational Lensing*](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170407847S)
   * Cluster sample (Table 1)
   * UDG sample, including stellar masses and Sérsic index (not in paper)
   * Weak lensing measurements and best-fit model (Figure 2)
   * MCMC posterior distribution (Figure 3), including derived parameters such as the mass enclosed within 10, 20 and 30 kpc (cf. Equations 8)

 * Sifón+16: [*The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Dynamical Masses for 44 SZ-Selected Galaxy Clusters over 755 Square Degrees*](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.461..248S)
   * Cluster redshifts, velocity dispersions, and dynamical masses (Table 2)
   * BCG peculiar velocities and DS test substructure significance (Figure 7)
   * Full catalog of spectroscopic redshifts (Table B1)
   
   **Note:** The results in this paper supersede those in [Sifón+13](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...772...25S)

 * Sifón+15b: [*The Masses of Satellites in GAMA Galaxy Groups from 100 Square Degrees of KiDS Weak Lensing Data*](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.454.3938S)
   * Satellite lensing measurements and best-fit model (Figure 5)
   * MCMC posterior distribution (Figure 6)
   * Satellite lensing covariance (Figure A1)

 * Sifón+15a: [*Constraints on the Alignments of Galaxies in Galaxy Clusters from ~14,000 Spectroscopic Members*](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A&A...575A..48S)
   * Cluster sample, redshifts, and velocity dispersions (Table 2, see also Figures 1, 3)
   * Purity and spectroscopic completeness of red sequence sample, and mock photo-z sample (Figure 4)
   * Intrinsic alignment measurements for all cluster members (Figure 8), in bins of cluster mass, redshift and dynamical state (Figure 9), and in bins of galaxy magnitude and color (Figure 10) 
   * BCG alignment measurements (Figure 11)
   * Satellite-satellite alignment measurements (Figure 12)
   * Intrinsic alignment power spectra (Figure 13)
