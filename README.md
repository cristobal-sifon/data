# data

*Under construction*

This repository hosts data from tables of figures in papers that I've published (and possibly ancillary data), in machine-readable format.

To be included:

 * Sifón+15a: [*Constraints on the Alignments of Galaxies in Galaxy Clusters from ~14,000 Spectroscopic
Members*](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A&A...575A..48S)
   * Cluster sample, redshifts, and velocity dispersions (Table 2, see also Figures 1, 3)
   * Purity and spectroscopic completeness of red sequence sample, and mock photo-z sample (Figure 4)
   * Intrinsic alignment measurements for all cluster members (Figure 8), in bins of cluster mass, redshift and dynamical state (Figure 9), and in bins of galaxy magnitude and color (Figure 10) 
   * BCG alignment measurements (Figure 11)
   * Satellite-satellite alignment measurements (Figure 12)
   * Intrinsic alignment power spectra (Figure 13)

 * Sifón+15b: [*The Masses of Satellites in GAMA Galaxy Groups from 100 Square Degrees of KiDS Weak Lensing 
Data*](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.454.3938S)
   * Satellite lensing measurements and best-fit model (Figure 5)
   * MCMC posterior distribution (Figure 6)
   * Satellite lensing covariance (Figure A1)
